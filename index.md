I am a software engineer at Google Cloud, leading the [Policy Intelligence](https://cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/tools-overview) direction and spearheading efforts in this area. As a cofounder of [IAM Recommender](https://cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/role-recommendations-overview), I have successfully applied Machine Learning techniques to safely reduce excess privilege. Before joining Google, I earned my PhD from [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/), where I conducted research under the guidance of [Prof. Alan Mislove](https://mislove.org/). My research focuses on distributed systems and networks, with a specific emphasis on harnessing the potential of local and cloud resources to enhance the security, privacy, and efficiency of emerging applications.
